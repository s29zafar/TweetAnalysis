# TweetAnalysis

This Project begins with hypothesis testing, looking first at a new variate: the use of hashtags. I will see how often users are employing
this feature, and compare that with past data to see if behaviours have changed. Understanding how user behaviour changes over time (or even
if it changes at all) is of key interest to product developers (and newly-installed CEOs), and can inform whether to keep, add, or remove
features. This is an opportunity for us to explore that very important principle.

I will then explored how often users are tweet-ing using hypothesis testing.

Our third analysis extends our investigation into the relationship between tweet length and number of likes received. 

I will finish off with a final analysis that explores what variates affect the number of likes a tweet receives. 

I will be using graphs and plots to confirm my analysis, examples of these are as follows:
